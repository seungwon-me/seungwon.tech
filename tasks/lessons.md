# Lessons Learned

Record repeatable lessons from corrections, bugs, failed verifications, and rework.
Add a new row when a user correction or review feedback reveals a pattern.

| Date | Area | What Happened | Root Cause | Prevention Rule | Action Item (Owner/When) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | [module/feature] | [short factual event] | [why it happened] | [future rule to follow] | [owner + due date] |

## Writing Rules

- Be concrete and evidence-based.
- Prefer one specific prevention rule over broad advice.
- Tie each lesson to a practical action item when possible.
- If the same mistake repeats, update the existing rule with stronger guardrails.
